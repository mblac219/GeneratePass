# GeneratePass

As a developer, I decided to come back rework some of my older projects from a previous web development bootcamp just to see how far I've come.  A lot of this didnt make sense in the beginning but its coming to me by the day. 
 I was given a task to complete. The HTML and CSS was starter code given to me and my objective is to apply Javascript in order to get the password generator working.
